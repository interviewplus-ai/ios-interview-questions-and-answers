## 1. What is a singleton pattern in iOS? Provide an example.

The singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created throughout the application. Here's an example in Swift:

```swift
class Singleton {
    static let shared = Singleton()
    private init() {}
}

let instance = Singleton.shared
```

## 2. Explain the concept of Key-Value Observing (KVO) in iOS with an example.

KVO allows one object to observe changes to a property of another object. Here's an example in Swift:

```swift
class MyObject: NSObject {
    @objc dynamic var value: Int = 0
}

let object = MyObject()

object.observe(\.value) { (object, _) in
    print("Value changed to \(object.value)")
}

object.value = 10 // Output: "Value changed to 10"
```
## 3. How do you perform asynchronous operations using Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)? Provide an example.

GCD provides a way to execute code asynchronously on different queues. Here's an example of running code on a background queue:

```swift
DispatchQueue.global().async {
    // Perform background task
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        // Update UI on the main queue
    }
}
```

## 4. What is Core Data in iOS? Provide an example of saving data using Core Data.

Core Data is a framework for managing the model layer objects in an application. Here's an example of saving data using Core Data in Swift:

```swift
// Define the managed object model
let appDelegate = UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate
let context = appDelegate.persistentContainer.viewContext

let entity = NSEntityDescription.entity(forEntityName: "Person", in: context)
let person = NSManagedObject(entity: entity!, insertInto: context)

person.setValue("John", forKey: "name")
person.setValue(30, forKey: "age")

do {
    try context.save()
    print("Data saved successfully!")
} catch {
    print("Failed to save data: \(error)")
}
```

## 5. How do you perform network requests in iOS? Provide an example using URLSession.

URLSession is commonly used for making network requests in iOS. Here's an example of making a GET request:

```swift
guard let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/data") else { return }

let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
    if let error = error {
        print("Error: \(error)")
    } else if let data = data {
        let responseString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
        print("Response: \(responseString ?? "")")
    }
}

task.resume()
```

## 6. How do you implement data persistence using UserDefaults? Provide an example.

UserDefaults is used to store small amounts of data persistently. Here's an example of storing and retrieving a value:

```swift
// Storing a value
UserDefaults.standard.set("John Doe", forKey: "username")

// Retrieving a value
if let username = UserDefaults.standard.string(forKey: "username") {
    print("Username: \(username)")
}
```

## 7. Explain the concept of delegation in iOS with an example.

Delegation is a design pattern used to establish communication between objects. Here's an example:

```swift
protocol MyDelegate: AnyObject {
    func didReceiveData(_ data: String)
}

class MyObject {
    weak var delegate: MyDelegate?

    func processData() {
        let data = "Processed data"
        delegate?.didReceiveData(data)
    }
}

class ViewController: UIViewController, MyDelegate {
    let myObject = MyObject()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        myObject.delegate = self
        myObject.processData()
    }

    func didReceiveData(_ data: String) {
        print("Received data: \(data)")
    }
}
```

## 8. How do you perform animations in iOS? Provide an example using UIView animations.

UIView animations can be used to create various animations in iOS. Here's an example of animating a view's alpha:

```swift
UIView.animate(withDuration: 0.5) {
    view.alpha = 0.0
}
```

## 9. Explain the concept of Auto Layout in iOS. Provide an example of creating constraints programmatically.

Auto Layout is used to create flexible and adaptive user interfaces. Here's an example of creating constraints programmatically:

```swift
let redView = UIView()
redView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
redView.backgroundColor = .red
view.addSubview(redView)

NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
    redView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.topAnchor, constant: 20),
    redView.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor, constant: 20),
    redView.widthAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 100),
    redView.heightAnchor.constraint(equalToConstant: 100)
])
```

## 10. How do you handle user input using gestures in iOS? Provide an example using UITapGestureRecognizer.

Gesture recognizers can be used to handle user input. Here's an example using UITapGestureRecognizer:

```swift
let tapGesture = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(handleTap(_:)))
view.addGestureRecognizer(tapGesture)

@objc func handleTap(_ gesture: UITapGestureRecognizer) {
    // Handle tap event
}
```

## 11. How do you handle background tasks in iOS? Provide an example using URLSession background configuration.

URLSession's background configuration allows tasks to continue even when the app is in the background. Here's an example of downloading a file in the background:

```swift
let url = URL(string: "https://example.com/file.pdf")!
let task = URLSession.shared.downloadTask(with: url) { (url, response, error) in
    // Handle downloaded file
}

task.resume()
```
